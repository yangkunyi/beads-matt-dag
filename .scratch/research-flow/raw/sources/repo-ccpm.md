### Spec-driven development for AI agents – ship ~~faster~~ _better_ using PRDs, GitHub issues, and multiple agents running in parallel.

Stop losing context. Stop blocking on tasks. Stop shipping bugs. CCPM gives your AI agent a structured PM brain: turn ideas into PRDs, PRDs into epics, epics into GitHub issues, and issues into production code — with full traceability at every step.

## Background

Every team struggles with the same problems:
- **Context evaporates** between sessions, forcing constant re-discovery
- **Parallel work creates conflicts** when multiple agents touch the same code
- **Requirements drift** as verbal decisions override written specs
- **Progress becomes invisible** until the very end

CCPM solves all of that.

```

### See It In Action

```
"I want to build a notification system — where do we start?"
→ Guided brainstorming + PRD creation

"break down the notification-system epic"
→ Parallelizable task files with dependencies

"sync the notification-system epic to GitHub"
→ Epic issue + sub-issues + worktree

"start working on issue 42"
→ Parallel stream analysis + multiple agents launched

"what's our standup for today?"
→ Instant report from project files
```

---

## What Makes This Different

| Traditional AI Development | CCPM |
|---|---|
| Context lost between sessions | **Persistent context** across all work |
| One agent, one task | **Parallel agents** on independent streams |
| Vibe coding from memory | **Spec-driven** with full traceability |
| Progress hidden in chat logs | **Transparent audit trail** in GitHub |
| Scattered status updates | **Structured standup, blocked, next** |

---

## Why GitHub Issues

Most AI coding workflows operate in isolation — a single session with no shared state. CCPM uses GitHub Issues as the source of truth, which unlocks something fundamentally different:

**Team collaboration** — multiple agents (or humans) work on the same project simultaneously. Progress is visible in real-time through issue comments.

**Seamless handoffs** — an agent can start a task, a human can finish it, or vice versa. No "what did the AI do?" meetings.

**Single source of truth** — no separate databases or project management tools. Issue state is project state. Comments are the audit trail.

**Works with what you have** — no dependency on GitHub Projects. Integrates with existing labels, milestones, and PR workflows.

---

## Core Principle: No Vibe Coding

> **Every line of code must trace back to a specification.**

CCPM enforces a strict 5-phase discipline:

1. **🧠 Brainstorm** — think deeper than comfortable
2. **📝 Document** — write specs that leave nothing to interpretation
3. **📐 Plan** — architect with explicit technical decisions
4. **⚡ Execute** — build exactly what was specified
5. **📊 Track** — maintain transparent progress at every step

No shortcuts. No assumptions. No regrets.

---

## The Parallel Execution System

### Issues Aren't Atomic

Traditional thinking: **one issue = one agent = one task**

Reality: a single "Implement user authentication" issue is actually:

- **Agent 1**: Database tables and migrations
- **Agent 2**: Service layer and business logic
- **Agent 3**: API endpoints and middleware
- **Agent 4**: UI components and forms
- **Agent 5**: Test suites and documentation

All running **simultaneously** in the same worktree.

### The Math of Velocity

| Approach | Agents working | Wall time |
|---|---|---|
| Traditional (serial) | 1 | 5x |
| CCPM (parallel streams) | 5 | 1x |

### Context Stays Clean

Each agent handles its own context in isolation. Your main conversation becomes the conductor — it never drowns in implementation details. Agents read from `.claude/epics/` and commit progress back through Git.

---

## Key Features & Benefits

**🧠 Context preservation** — project state lives in files, not in your head or chat history. Start a session anywhere, any time.

**⚡ Parallel execution** — tasks marked `parallel: true` run concurrently across multiple agents without conflicts.

**🔗 GitHub native** — works with tools your team already uses. No dependency on the Projects API.

**📊 Full traceability** — every decision documented. PRD → Epic → Task → Issue → Code → Commit.

**🤖 Deterministic ops run as scripts** — status, standup, search, validate all run as bash scripts: fast, consistent, no LLM token cost.

**🌐 Harness-agnostic** — follows the [agentskills.io](https://agentskills.io) open standard. Works with Factory, Claude Code, Amp, OpenCode, Codex, Cursor, and more.

---

## Install

CCPM is a standard [Agent Skill](https://agentskills.io). Point your harness at `skill/ccpm/` — that's it.

### Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/automazeio/ccpm.git
```

### Factory / Droid

```bash
# Symlink into your skills directory
ln -s /path/to/ccpm/skill/ccpm ~/.factory/skills/ccpm
```

### Claude Code

In your project root, add a `skills/` directory and symlink or copy the skill:

```bash
ln -s /path/to/ccpm/skill/ccpm .claude/skills/ccpm
```

### Any other Agent Skills–compatible harness

Point it at `skill/ccpm/`. It follows the [agentskills.io](https://agentskills.io) standard and works out of the box.

### Prerequisites

- `git` and `gh` CLI (authenticated: `gh auth login`)
- A GitHub repository for your project

---

## Usage

CCPM activates automatically when your agent detects PM intent. Just talk naturally — no special syntax needed.

### Natural language triggers

| What you say | What happens |
|---|---|
| "I want to build X" / "let's plan X" | Brainstorming + PRD creation |
| "parse the X PRD" / "create an epic for X" | PRD → technical epic |
| "break down the X epic" | Epic decomposition into tasks |
| "sync the X epic to GitHub" | Issues created, worktree set up |
| "start working on issue N" | Analysis + parallel agents launched |
| "standup" / "what's our status" | Bash script runs instantly |
| "what's next" / "what's blocked" | Priority queue from project files |
| "close issue N" | Local + GitHub updated |
| "merge the X epic" | Tests, merge, cleanup |

---

## Workflow Phases

### 1. Plan — Capture requirements

```
"I want to build a notification system — push, email, and in-app"
```

CCPM conducts guided brainstorming before writing anything. It asks about the problem, users, success criteria, constraints, and what's out of scope — then creates a structured PRD at `.claude/prds/<name>.md`.

When ready: "parse the notification-system PRD" → produces a technical epic at `.claude/epics/notification-system/epic.md` with architecture decisions, technical approach, and task preview.

### 2. Structure — Break it down

```
"break down the notification-system epic into tasks"
```

Each task gets a file with acceptance criteria, effort estimate, `depends_on`, `parallel`, and `conflicts_with` metadata. Tasks are intelligently batched for parallel creation. ≤10 tasks per epic by default.

### 3. Sync — Push to GitHub

```
"sync the notification-system epic to GitHub"
```

Creates an epic issue, creates sub-issues for each task, renames local files to match GitHub issue numbers, sets up a dedicated worktree (`../epic-notification-system/`), and creates a mapping file for reference.

### 4. Execute — Start building

```
"start working on issue 42"
```

Analyzes the issue for independent work streams, launches parallel agents scoped to their own files, and sets up progress tracking. Each agent commits with `Issue #N: description` and coordinates through Git.

### 5. Track — Know where things stand

```
"standup" / "what's blocked" / "what's next"
```

All tracking operations run as bash scripts — instant output, no LLM overhead. The scripts scan `.claude/epics/` and report what's in progress, what's next, and what's blocked.

Your project files live in `.claude/` in your project root:

```
.claude/
├── prds/                     # Product requirement documents
├── epics/
│   └── <feature>/
│       ├── epic.md           # Technical epic

## Example Flow

```
You: "I want to build a payment integration with Stripe — subscriptions and one-time charges"

CCPM: Asks 5 clarifying questions about scope, users, success criteria...

You: [answers]

CCPM: ✅ PRD created: .claude/prds/payment-integration.md
      Ready to create the technical epic?

You: "yes, parse it"

CCPM: ✅ Epic created: .claude/epics/payment-integration/epic.md
      8 task categories identified. Ready to decompose?

You: "break it down"

CCPM: ✅ Created 7 tasks — 5 parallel, 2 sequential
      Ready to push to GitHub?

You: "sync it"

CCPM: ✅ Epic #1234 created
      ✅ 7 sub-issues created (#1235–#1241)
      ✅ Worktree: ../epic-payment-integration/

## Technical Notes

**GitHub integration** — uses `gh-sub-issue` extension for proper parent-child relationships. Falls back to task lists if not installed. Install with: `gh extension install yahsan2/gh-sub-issue`

**File naming** — tasks start as `001.md`, `002.md` during decomposition. After GitHub sync, renamed to `{issue-id}.md` (e.g. `1234.md`). Issue #1234 = file `1234.md`.

**Design decisions** — intentionally avoids GitHub Projects API complexity. All operations work on local files first for speed. GitHub sync is explicit and controlled. Worktrees provide clean git isolation for parallel work.

**Looking for v1?** — The original `/pm:*` Claude Code slash command system is preserved on the [`v1` branch](https://github.com/automazeio/ccpm/tree/v1).
