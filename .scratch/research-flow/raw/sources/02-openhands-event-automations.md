# Event-Based Automations

> Trigger automations from GitHub events or custom webhooks instead of cron schedules.

Event-based automations run when something happens—a PR is opened, an issue is commented on, or a webhook fires—instead of on a schedule. This is ideal for responsive workflows like auto-reviewing PRs, triaging issues, or reacting to external service events.

## Prerequisites for GitHub Event Automations

GitHub event automations require some one-time setup before events will flow. If any step is missing, automations will appear to work (manual triggers succeed) but GitHub events will silently never arrive.

### 1. Install the OpenHands GitHub App

The OpenHands GitHub App must be installed on the GitHub organization that owns the repositories you want to monitor. Install it from your [GitHub integration settings](/openhands/usage/cloud/github-installation). The app needs access to the repositories that will generate events.

### 2. Create an OpenHands Team Organization

If you're working with repositories owned by a GitHub organization (e.g., `myorg/my-repo`), you need an OpenHands **team organization** — not just a personal account. GitHub events for org repos are routed to team orgs, not personal orgs.

If you don't already have one, create a team organization — see [What Are Organizations](/openhands/usage/cloud/organizations/overview#what-are-organizations) for details and how to get started.

### 3. Claim Your GitHub Organization

<Warning>
  **This is the most commonly missed step.** Without it, GitHub events have nowhere to be routed and will be silently dropped.
</Warning>

Your OpenHands team org must **claim** the GitHub organization to establish the link between GitHub webhooks and your OpenHands org. Claiming tells the event router: *"Events for repos in this GitHub org should go to this OpenHands team org."*

To claim a GitHub org:

1. Switch to your team org using the org switcher in the sidebar
2. Go to **Organization Settings**
3. In the **Git Conversation Routing** section, find your GitHub org
4. Click **Claim**

You must be an **Owner** of the OpenHands team org and have **admin access** to the GitHub org to complete the claim. See [Claiming Git Organizations](/openhands/usage/cloud/organizations/settings#claiming-git-organizations) for full details.

<Tip>
  Each GitHub organization can only be claimed by one OpenHands team org. If another team has already claimed it, coordinate with them or contact support.
</Tip>

### 4. Create the Automation Under the Team Org

Make sure you are switched to the **team org** (not your personal org) when creating the automation. The automation must live in the same org that claimed the GitHub organization — otherwise events won't match.

### 5. (Optional) Add Service Accounts to the Team Org

If you're using a service account (like a bot account) to create or own automations, that account must be a **member of the team org**. Invite them from the [Organization Members](/openhands/usage/cloud/organizations/managing-members) page.

### Troubleshooting

If your automation doesn't trigger on GitHub events:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="GitHub App not installed on the org">
    The OpenHands GitHub App must be installed on the GitHub organization that owns your repositories. Go to [GitHub integration settings](/openhands/usage/cloud/github-installation) and verify it is installed with access to the relevant repos. Without this, no webhook events are sent to OpenHands.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="GitHub org not claimed">
    The most common cause. Go to **Organization Settings → Git Conversation Routing** and check if your GitHub org shows as claimed. If not, click **Claim**. See [Claiming Git Organizations](/openhands/usage/cloud/organizations/settings#claiming-git-organizations).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Automation in personal org instead of team org">
    GitHub events for org repos are routed to the **team org** that claimed the GitHub org. If you created the automation under your personal org, events will never reach it. Switch to the team org and recreate the automation.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Event type or filter mismatch">
    Double-check that the event type (e.g., `pull_request.labeled`) and filter expression match the action you're testing. Use wildcards like `pull_request.*` to match all actions during debugging.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Automation is disabled">
    Verify the automation is enabled. You can check via the automations list or by asking OpenHands to list your automations.
  </Accordion>

## Built-In vs. Custom Integrations

| Type                  | Setup                                                                                                     | Best For                                       |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Built-in (GitHub)** | One-time org setup ([see above](#prerequisites-for-github-event-automations)), then create the automation | PR reviews, issue triage, push-triggered tasks |
| **Custom Webhooks**   | Register webhook first, then create automation                                                            | Linear, Stripe, Slack, and other services      |

## GitHub Events (Built-In)

GitHub is a built-in integration. Create automations that respond to GitHub events without any webhook setup.

### Example: Auto-Review PRs with a Specific Label

When a PR is labeled with `openhands`, automatically review it:

```
Create an event-based automation called "Auto Review PRs" that triggers
when a pull request is labeled with "openhands" in any of my repos.

It should review the PR for code quality and best practices, then post
the review as a comment.
```

The agent will create an automation with:

* **Trigger type**: `event`
* **Source**: `github`
* **Event**: `pull_request.labeled`
* **Filter**: Matches PRs labeled `openhands`

### Example: Respond to @openhands Mentions

```
Create an automation that responds when someone mentions @openhands
in an issue comment. It should analyze the issue context and provide
a helpful response.
```

### Available GitHub Events

| Event           | Common Actions                                         | Use Case              |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------- |
| `pull_request`  | `opened`, `labeled`, `synchronize`, `ready_for_review` | PR automation         |
| `issues`        | `opened`, `labeled`, `assigned`                        | Issue triage          |
| `issue_comment` | `created`                                              | Mention responses     |
| `push`          | —                                                      | Branch-based triggers |
| `release`       | `published`                                            | Release workflows     |

Use wildcards like `pull_request.*` to match all actions for an event type.

### Filtering Events

Filters let you narrow which events trigger your automation. They use [JMESPath expressions](https://jmespath.org/) to match fields in the event payload—so you can trigger only on specific labels, users, branches, or other conditions.

<Note>
  OpenHands extends standard JMESPath with custom functions including `icontains` (case-insensitive string match) and `glob` (wildcard path matching). It also supports `!` (negation), `&&` (AND), and `||` (OR) as boolean operators. These extensions are not part of the [JMESPath specification](https://jmespath.org/specification.html).
</Note>

**Common filter patterns:**

```
contains(pull_request.labels[].name, 'openhands')

icontains(comment.body, '@openhands')

glob(repository.full_name, 'myorg/*')

ref == 'refs/heads/main'

glob(repository.full_name, 'myorg/*') && contains(pull_request.labels[].name, 'bug')
```

* `contains(...)` — match a specific label
* `icontains(...)` — case-insensitive mention in a comment body
* `glob(...)` — match repos in your org with wildcards
* `==` — exact match (e.g., push to main branch only)
* `&&` — combine multiple conditions

## Custom Webhooks

For services beyond GitHub—like Linear, Stripe, or Slack—register a custom webhook first, then create automations that use it.

<Note>
  **Two-phase workflow for custom webhooks:**

  1. **Webhook registration (one-time setup)**: You execute the curl command yourself to register the webhook. This keeps your signing secrets secure—the agent provides the command but never handles your credentials directly.

  2. **Automation creation (repeatable)**: Once the webhook is registered, the agent can create, update, and manage automations for that webhook source conversationally—no manual curl commands needed.
</Note>

### Walkthrough: Linear Integration

<Note>
  This example walks through setting up a Linear webhook to auto-triage new issues using Automations in **[OpenHands Cloud](https://app.all-hands.dev)**.
</Note>

#### Step 1: Get Your Webhook Secret from Linear

Linear provides the webhook signing secret—you cannot configure your own.

1. Go to **Linear Settings → API → Webhooks**
2. Click **New webhook**
3. Copy the **signing secret** that Linear displays (you'll need this in the next step)
4. Leave the webhook URL blank for now—you'll get it from OpenHands

#### Step 2: Register the Webhook with OpenHands

First, set up your environment variables:

1. Create an OpenHands API key at [app.all-hands.dev/settings/api-keys](https://app.all-hands.dev/settings/api-keys)
2. Export the API key and the webhook secret from Step 1:

```bash theme={null}
export OPENHANDS_API_KEY="your-openhands-api-key"
export LINEAR_WEBHOOK_SECRET="your-linear-signing-secret-from-step-1"
```

Then run the following command to register the webhook:

```bash theme={null}
curl -X POST "https://app.all-hands.dev/api/automation/v1/webhooks" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${OPENHANDS_API_KEY}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Linear Issues",
    "source": "linear",
    "event_key_expr": "type",
    "signature_header": "Linear-Signature",
    "webhook_secret": "'"${LINEAR_WEBHOOK_SECRET}"'"
  }'
```

The response includes a `webhook_url` that you'll configure in Linear.

<Accordion title="Understanding event_key_expr">
  The `event_key_expr` is a JMESPath expression that extracts the event type from incoming webhook payloads. This extracted value is what you match against in the automation's `on` field.

  For example, Linear sends payloads like:

  ```json theme={null}
  {"type": "Issue", "action": "create", "data": {...}}
  ```

  With `event_key_expr: "type"`, the system extracts `"Issue"` as the event type. Then in your automation, you set `on: "Issue"` to match it.
</Accordion>

<Tip>
  If you're integrating a service that lets you configure the signing secret (unlike Linear), you can omit `webhook_secret` from the request. The automation service will generate one and return it in the response—store it securely, as it's shown only once.
</Tip>

#### Step 3: Complete the Linear Webhook Configuration

1. Return to the Linear webhook you started in Step 1
2. Paste the `webhook_url` from the previous step
3. Select which events to send (e.g., Issues, Comments)
4. Save the webhook

#### Step 4: Create the Automation

Now the webhook is registered, the agent can create automations for you end-to-end. Just describe what you want:

```
Create an event-based automation called "Triage Linear Issues" that triggers
when a new issue is created in Linear.

It should analyze the issue title and description, suggest appropriate labels,
and add a comment with initial triage notes.
```

The agent creates the automation with:

* **Source**: `linear` (your registered webhook)
* **Event**: `Issue` (Linear's event type)
* **Filter**: `action == 'create'`

### Custom Webhook Parameters

When registering any custom webhook, these parameters define how OpenHands processes incoming events:

| Parameter          | Required | Description                                                   |
| ------------------ | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`             | Yes      | Human-readable name                                           |
| `source`           | Yes      | Unique identifier (lowercase, alphanumeric with hyphens)      |
| `event_key_expr`   | No       | JMESPath to extract event type (default: `type`)              |
| `signature_header` | No       | Header containing HMAC signature (default: `X-Signature-256`) |
| `webhook_secret`   | No       | Signing secret—provide yours or let the system generate one   |

### Common Services

These are example configurations for popular services. **Always verify with each service's webhook documentation**, as signature headers and payload formats may change.

| Service | Signature Header     | Event Key | Notes                                                                  |
| ------- | -------------------- | --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Linear  | `Linear-Signature`   | `type`    |                                                                        |
| Stripe  | `Stripe-Signature`   | `type`    | Uses a custom `t=timestamp,v1=signature` format — verify compatibility |
| Slack   | `X-Slack-Signature`  | `type`    |                                                                        |
| Twilio  | `X-Twilio-Signature` | `type`    | Uses HMAC-SHA1 of request URL + params — verify compatibility          |
