# Kiro Docs

> Kiro is an AI coding agent built around one unified agent harness: the same agent, sessions, and configuration across every surface. Use it in the Kiro IDE, the Kiro CLI, on the web, on mobile (iOS), with Kiro Crew for orchestrating teams of agents, and in any ACP-compatible editor. Capabilities include spec-driven development, steering, hooks, MCP, custom agents and subagents, skills, powers, and capability-based permissions. This index lists every docs page.

Each page has a Markdown twin at the same path with a `.md` suffix (`/docs/specs` becomes `/docs/specs.md`). Fetch the `.md` version for clean Markdown without site chrome. Child pages are indented under their parent.
