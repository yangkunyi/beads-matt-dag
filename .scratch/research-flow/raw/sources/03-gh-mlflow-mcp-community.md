# MLflow MCP Server

A [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server that enables LLMs to interact with [MLflow](https://mlflow.org) tracking servers. Query experiments, analyze runs, compare metrics, manage the model registry, and promote models to production — all through natural language.

## Features

- **Experiment Management**: List, search, and filter experiments
- **Run Analysis**: Query runs, compare metrics, find best performing models
- **Metrics & Parameters**: Get metric histories, compare parameters across runs
- **Artifacts**: Browse and download run artifacts
- **LoggedModel Support**: Search and retrieve MLflow 3 LoggedModel entities
- **Model Registry**: Full registry management — register, tag, alias, stage, and promote models
- **Write & Delete Actions**: Tag, alias, register, promote, and delete runs/experiments/models
- **MCP Prompts**: Built-in guided workflows for common tasks
- **Pagination**: Offset-based pagination for browsing large result sets

## Installation

### Using uvx (Recommended)

```bash
# Run directly without installation
uvx mlflow-mcp

# Or install globally
pip install mlflow-mcp
```

### From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kkruglik/mlflow-mcp.git
cd mlflow-mcp
uv sync
uv run mlflow-mcp
```

## Configuration

### Claude Desktop

Add to your Claude Desktop config file:

- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Linux**: `~/.config/claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mlflow": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["mlflow-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI": "http://localhost:5000"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Claude Code (project-scoped)

Add `.mcp.json` to your project root:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mlflow": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["mlflow-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI": "http://localhost:5000"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Authenticated Server

For MLflow servers with authentication, add credentials to the `env` block:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mlflow": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["mlflow-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI": "https://mlflow.company.com",
        "MLFLOW_TRACKING_USERNAME": "your-username",
        "MLFLOW_TRACKING_PASSWORD": "your-password"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

For Databricks or token-based auth, use `MLFLOW_TRACKING_TOKEN` instead:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mlflow": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["mlflow-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI": "https://mlflow.company.com",
        "MLFLOW_TRACKING_TOKEN": "your-token"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Usage Examples

### Explore experiments and runs

> "Show me all experiments. Which ones were updated recently?"

> "What metrics and parameters are tracked in experiment 'fraud-detection'?"

> "Get the top 10 runs in 'fraud-detection' sorted by test/f1. Show me the params that differ most between the top 3."

> "Find all runs tagged with model_type=lightgbm and compare their recall scores."

### Analyze a training run

> "Show me the full details of run abc123 — metrics, params, and artifacts."

> "Plot the training loss curve for run abc123." *(Claude fetches metric history and renders a chart)*

> "This run has a parent — show me the parent run and compare their metrics."

### Find and register the best model

> "Find the best logged model in experiment 'fraud-detection' by test/recall. Register it as 'fraud-classifier' with a selection_metric tag."

> "Which logged model in experiments 1 and 2 has the highest F1 score on the validation set?"

> "Register the model from run abc123 artifact path 'model/' as 'my-classifier'."

### Manage the model registry

> "Show me all versions of 'fraud-classifier' with their aliases and stages."

> "Set the champion alias on version 3 of fraud-classifier."

> "Update the description of fraud-classifier v3 to explain what dataset it was trained on."

> "Copy fraud-classifier v3 to a separate 'fraud-classifier-prod' model as the production entry."

### Audit your MLflow setup

> "Audit my MLflow setup"

*(Triggers the `audit_mlflow_setup` built-in prompt — Claude explores experiments, runs, artifacts, and the model registry, then scores each area against Google/Databricks best practices)*

<summary>Example output</summary>

```
| Category             | Score  | Top Issue                                      |
|----------------------|--------|------------------------------------------------|
| Experiment Org       |  5/10  | Flat namespace, no dot-notation hierarchy      |
| Parameter Logging    |  7/10  | No parent-child nesting for tuning sweeps      |
| Metric Logging       |  6/10  | Only final values logged, no training curves   |
| Tagging Strategy     |  5/10  | Params duplicated as tags; stale test_tag      |
| Artifact Management  |  2/10  | No log_model(); artifacts on local disk        |
| Model Registry       |  3/10  | Duplicate prod models instead of aliases       |
| Reproducibility      |  3/10  | No git SHA; no mlflow.log_input() datasets     |
| Mean Score           |  4.4/10|                                                |

Top 3 improvements:
1. Call log_model() and move artifact store to S3/GCS
2. Add git SHA tag + mlflow.log_input() for dataset tracking
3. Consolidate registry to one model entry with @champion alias
```

### End-to-end promotion workflow

> "Find the best model in 'fraud-detection' by test/recall, register it as 'fraud-classifier', tag it with the framework and problem type, and set it as champion. Ask me before copying to prod."

*(This maps directly to the `promote_best_model` built-in prompt)*

## Debugging

Use [MCP Inspector](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector) to browse tools, call them with custom inputs, and inspect raw responses — without involving an LLM.

**Published package:**
```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector uvx mlflow-mcp
```

**Local source:**
```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector uv run --project /path/to/mlflow-mcp mlflow-mcp
```

Set `MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI` in the Inspector's environment panel, or pass it inline:

```bash
MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI=http://127.0.0.1:5000 npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector uvx mlflow-mcp
```

## Requirements
