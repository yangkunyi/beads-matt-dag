# RE-Bench

Evaluating frontier AI R&D capabilities of language model agents against human experts

We intend for these tasks to serve as example evaluation material aimed at measuring the autonomous AI R&D capabilities of AI agents. For more information, see [the full paper](https://metr.org/AI_R_D_Evaluation_Report.pdf).




## METR Task Standard
All the tasks in this repo conform to the [METR Task Standard](https://github.com/METR/task-standard).

The METR Task Standard is our attempt at defining a common format for tasks. We hope that this format will help facilitate easier task sharing and agent evaluation.

See the [setup guide](./setup) for getting started running this task suite with [Vivaria](https://vivaria.metr.org/) and our open source [agent scaffolding](https://github.com/poking-agents/modular-public).

## License

This repo is licensed under the MIT License. See [LICENSE](./LICENSE) for details.

In addition to this license we informally request that people take reasonable steps to keep these tasks out of LLM training data and avoid overfitting, including:

 1. Avoiding publishing un-protected solutions to these tasks.
 2. Avoiding providing evaluation material to APIs or services that may use the material for training.
 3. Not using this evaluation material to train or otherwise improve the abilities of frontier models, except as part of the intended use-case. *(That is, for the development or implementation of dangerous capability evaluations for determining limits and required mitigations for safe capability scaling.)*

## Notice on Password-Protected Solutions

To help protect solution information from ending up in training data, some tasks have files that are only available via password-protected zips.

We would like to ask that people do not publish un-protected solutions to these tasks.

If you accidentally publish a solution to a password-protected task, or find un-protected solutions online, please let us know at `tasks[at]metr.org` so we can take steps to ensure the integrity of the task.

Before using password-protected files, you'll need to extract them with the script `extract_protected_files.py`. The password is `resident-peacock-motif-grading`.
